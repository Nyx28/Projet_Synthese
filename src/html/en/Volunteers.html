            <h2>The Help Of International Volunteers</h2>
            <h3>What kind of help are they bringing</h3>
            <p>
                The help from international volunteers is crucial for the well-being of the organization.
                With their financial help and their manual labor, ADESJO is able to increase the number of projects made
                in
                the communities. Their implication over the year with our association as made them an integral part of
                us,
                and year after year our relations with the different groups of volunteers became only stronger.
                There is also a big part of the groups that are helping us whom end up coming every year around the same
                date, those group of veteran are now even included in the annual planning made by the administration.
            </p>

            <h3>Projects of Aqueducts</h3>
            <p> This kind of project is one where the end goal is to bring water to a community. This is made by digging
                up trenches from a reservoir (and sometime building it too) towards the village or the fields.
                This includes breaking the ground with pickaxes and moving it with shovels until an acceptable depth is
                achieved to put in the water pipes. Depending on the length of the trenches needed, those projects are
                not
                always finished when the group is leaving, they can either be finished another year by the same group,
                by other group of volunteers or by the local brigade.</p>

            <h3>Construction of Houses</h3>
            <p> Many groups are coming to work with us to build houses for the impoverished. They are often hosted in a
                school or a community center in the community where they'll go help. The financial help goes to buying
                the
                different materials for the construction and buying furniture for the family. Those projects are
                realized by
                sending engineers and a brigade of locals to work with the group of volunteers, this kind of project
                usually
                involve a lot of different tasks including digging up the ground with shovels and pickaxes to install
                the
                foundations, making cement, erecting the walls and if they are here for a long enough time, doing the
                finishes such as painting and pouring the floor. In the case where the house isn't done when the group
                leaves, the brigade will still finish it over the course of the following weeks.

            </p>

            <h3>Project of Natural Resources</h3>
            <p>
                This type of project include a lot of different tasks. The most frequent one is a project of
                reforestation, this is very important to reduce the landslide and increase the water retention in the
                soil. Another one is the construction of greenhouses in the community to increase the financial
                situation of the members of the community.
            </p>

            <h3>Health Related Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Those kind of projects are a bit more specialized. For example, some volunteers that comes every year to
                help are a group of dentists from the United States of America. Every day for a week, they go in a
                different
                community to provide free dental care to all the surroundings. Those kind of project can be various, but
                are
                to be made by specialists in their respective field and need a bit more organization and preparation.

            </p>

            <h3>Intercultural Exchange Projects For The Youth</h3>
            <p>
                This is a new kind of project. The goal of those projects are on one side to increase the relations
                between
                ADESJO and the future leaders of volunteer groups and on the other side to make experience the youth
                from
                here the culture and language of other country. 3-5 people between 18 and 25 years old are sent to live
                with different family of members of ADESJO, they can live the day-to-day life in a dominican family,
                work during the week increase their spanish mastery over the course of the project. The kind of work
                varies
                a lot, sometimes they are sent to live for a week in a community to help working over projects like
                aqueducts or helping other group of volunteers, and at other times they can help at the office or with
                smaller-sized projects. On the other side, the group from here that goes into another country will
                follow
                the agenda of the one who host them. This exchange is not synchronous, for references the first project
                like
                that was with a group of Canadians that came in the summer of 2024, while the group of dominicans will
                be
                going in the summer of 2025 over there.

            </p>

            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p>

                There is a lot of ways to help. The two most common one are either by coming here with a group to help
                in
                a community, or by sending a donation to help fund other projects. To have more information regarding
                either
                of those way of helping our impoverished, email us at
