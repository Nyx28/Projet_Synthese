            <h2>A Brief History of ADESJO</h2>

            <h3>Origin of ADESJO</h3>
            <p>The dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo had just ended and the Republic was enjoying its first
                airs of freedom. The situation in the country was still precarious. In San José de Ocoa,a group of men
                and
                women met on July 12, 1962, and formed the Development Board, later known as the Association for the
                Development of San José de Ocoa, Inc. (ADESJO). It was proposed that the rural communities be given the
                power and capacity to improve their economic and social conditions. Since that time, the institution has
                promoted full development through the use of the CONVITE, which is the traditional practice of people
                participating as volunteers in work activities carried out for a common objective, and following the
                slogan : <br>
                <i style="font-size: 21px">"Personal effort and mutual help"</i>.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
            <p>
                This model of full community development drives ADESJO and its community organizations to apply
                sustainable, innovative technologies and practice through the participation of the communities
                themselves,
                in both urban and rural areas, thereby contributing to the development of families, the promotion of a
                culture of democracy, and the improvement of the quality of life.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>ADESJO promotes the full and sustainable development of the province of San José de Ocoa and surrounding
                areas
                through the participation of its inhabitants in programs of self-determination in the social, economic,
                education, cultural, environmental and health related fields</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Purpose of the Association</h3>
            <p>It aims to promote the economic, social and cultural development of the entire community of Ocoa, and its
                surrounding areas, and to raise the quality of life and level of well-being.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>ADESJO is commited to supporting the men and women of the communities of Ocoa as they struggle to improve
                the
                conditions of the most impoverished members of society for their full development. The work of ADESJO
                is based on the indispensable participation of the people themselves so that they can be the social
                actors
                determining their own destiny, that is, bring self-reliance <br>
                The institution is sensitive to the motives and struggles carried out by the specific communities, and
                it
                supports them as they identify their own problems and need. Furthermore, the beneficiary populations are
                involved in the decision-making processes and carry out the work through the traditional practice of the
                CONVITE, that is, by participating in volunteer work brigades.
